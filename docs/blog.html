      <p style="width: 80%; font-size: 1.3em;">It's been almost two weeks since v1.1.0 has been released. We've been hard at work on Titanium 1.1.1, which is going to be packed with new features. We plan to include a complete set of navigation bars as stated on our board. This update will also include some JS, making the leap from our original vanilla CSS. We're also bringing back shadows. <b>You can find a beta version <a href="https://rappatic.github.io/titanium/documentation.html#/docs/beta/README">here</a>.<br><br>v1.1.2 will include a ton of smaller things, such as badges, button groups, and options for opacity.<br>Later on in the development, we plan to bring about some heavier features that include a lot of Javascript. Examples of this include carousels, so you can place multiple images and flip through them with selector buttons, dropdowns, and forms.</p>
