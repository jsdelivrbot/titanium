### Container Layout

Containers are the most basic element in Titanium, but they are also very powerful. They can be used to hold text, to display images, and to dictate where elements are displayed on your page.

There are 7 different options for sizing containers:

* `jumbo` This displays a container spanning the entire width of the parent element
* `xl` This displays a container spanning four-fifths of the parent element
* `large` This displays a container spanning three-fifths of the parent element
* `medium` This displays a container spanning half the parent element
* `small` This displays a container spanning two-fifths of the parent element
* `xs` This displays a container spanning one-fifth of the parent element
* `tiny` This displays a container spanning one-tenth of the parent element

Containers, by default, align to the left and prevent other elements from entering their line. To allow containers to stack:

* `stack-left` This allows containers to stack to the left of the screen
* `stack-right` This allows containers to stack to the right of the screen

All containers must have these classes that wish to stack.

You can center a container inside its parent element with the class `container-center`.
