### Margins

When an element has margins, it prevents other elements from intruding into the space around itself. There are 7 default sizes for margins:

- `margin-jumbo`- Gives a margin of 5%
- `margin-xl` - Gives a margin of 4%
- `margin-large` - Gives a margin of 3%
- `margin-medium` - Gives a margin of 2%
- `margin-small` - Gives a margin of 1%
- `margin-xs` - Gives a margin of 0.5%
- `margin-tiny` - Gives a margin of 0.25%


For example, note how the element does not touch the outside of the screen.


```
<div class="small pad-medium margin-medium">
  Look! I have even more space now!
</div>
```
