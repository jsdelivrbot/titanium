### Padding

Similar to sizing containers, Titanium has 7 different classes for padding.

- `pad-jumbo`- Gives a padding of 5%
- `pad-xl` - Gives a padding of 4%
- `pad-large` - Gives a padding of 3%
- `pad-medium` - Gives a padding of 2%
- `pad-small` - Gives a padding of 1%
- `pad-xs` - Gives a padding of 0.5%
- `pad-tiny` - Gives a padding of 0.25%

Example:

```
<div class="small pad-medium">
  Look! I have space to breathe!
</div>
```

When you add padding to an element, the padding is added to the *inside* of the element, as opposed to the outside, so your element will retain its original size no matter how much padding you put on it. Keep in mind your usable space inside the elment will get smaller.
