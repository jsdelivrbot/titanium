### Cobalt

Cobalt is a font stack containing all 850-ish Google Font API fonts. It pulls only the fonts used in your webpage, making for instant load times.

It can be used with or without Titanium.

**With Titanium**

Cobalt is designed to work alongside Titanium. If you already use it, then it's easy to install Cobalt as well. Add the following to the `head` section of your webpage:

`<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/rappatic/titanium/master/cobalt/cobalt.js">`

**Without Titanium**

Add the following to the `head` section of your webpage:

`<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/rappatic/titanium/master/cobalt/cobalt.js">`

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/rappatic/titanium/master/cobalt/cobalt.css">`
