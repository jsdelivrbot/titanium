### Borders and Bars

You can very easily add a border to a container in Titanium with the `border-` class followed by a color. For example, if you wished to add a Royal Blue border, you would add the class `border-royalblue`.

If you wished to add a bar (a very thick border on one side) you add the side the bar should be on, followed by `bar-`, then the color. For example, if you wished to add a Yellow bar on the left, you would use the class `leftbar-yellow`.
