### Rounding Corners

Round the corners of divs and other elements with the `corners-` classes, which has a size range of `corners-tiny` to `corners-xl`. For example, if you wished to have a container with rounded edges, you could use the code:


```
<div class="bg-black corners-medium">
...
</div>
```
