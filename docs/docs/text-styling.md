### Styling Text

There are many ways to style text with Titanium. The first is sizing - you can size text using the same sizes as you would for containers.

* `text-jumbo` Displays a text size of 600%, which scales down as the screen gets smaller
* `text-xl` Displays a text size of 500%, which scales down as the screen gets smaller
* `text-large` Displays a text size of 400%
* `text-medium` Displays a text size of 300%
* `text-small` Displays a text size of 200%
* `text-xs` Displays a text size of 150%
* `text-tiny` Displays a text size of 100%

Additionally, you can center the text with `text-center`, make the text bold with `text-bold` and make the text italics with `text-italics`.

Only one of the following can be used at a time, or else one will override the others:

* `text-underline` Underlines the text
* `text-strike` Gives the text a strikethrough
* `text-overline` Gives the text a line over itself

You can also color the text with the 14 standard colors included in Titanium, by using the class `text-` followed by the color name, lowercase and without spaces. For example, if you wish to use the color Royal Blue for your text, use the class `text-royalblue`.
