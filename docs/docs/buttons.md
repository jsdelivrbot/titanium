### Buttons

You can make the `a` tag a button by adding the class `button-square` to it. You can style this with bg-color, text-color, and all other text styling. 

Add rounded corners with the `corners-` tag which supports `corners-tiny` up to `corners-xl`. A circular button uses the class `button-oval`.
