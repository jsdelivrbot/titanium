### Titanium beta

The Titanium **beta** is a great way to test out the new indev features that are coming soon to Titanium. New releases happen all the time, though they may be buggy and unstable. Use **beta** at your own risk.

### Installing beta

Add the following to the `head` section of your webpage:
